1. I have several feeds I read almost daily
2. I follow lots of people involved in web standards or browser development or are just very good developers
3. I actually read specifications from time to time, some of them are easy to understand and they are first-hand sources. W3C mailing lists also help: You learn about web technologies at the moment of their creation and can even influence them!
4. Conferences, both for the discussions and the sessions
