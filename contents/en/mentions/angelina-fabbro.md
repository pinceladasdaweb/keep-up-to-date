I follow people on Twitter who produce new things. Some people like to follow just blogs, but I like to see what the people who make things recommend. My Twitter feed has sort of replaced my old RSS feed to some extent - I am way more likely to read an article recommended by someone who I see posting their repos alongside it. That kind of behavior tells me that the person is both an active developer and someone who thinks about their craft in most cases.

I'm trying to spend more time on various W3C working group and specification mailing lists. There is a lot that goes over my head about the specific implementations of features that as a web developer I would take for granted every day. Sometimes keeping up is challenging, but I like a good challenge and as I stick around I learn more and more so I can ideally contribute more to the discussion in the future.

There is a saying that goes around: "If you feel like you are the smartest person in the room, you're in the wrong room." Surround yourself with people who are intelligent but not cocky about it.
