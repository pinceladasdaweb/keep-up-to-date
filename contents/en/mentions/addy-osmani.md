These days I find myself heavily relying on Twitter lists and G+ circles to keep up to date with what's happening on the front-end.

If there are tools or libraries I regularly use, I try to keep an eye on what the developers working on them might have to say because that's how you find out insights, tips/tricks and information about what's coming next.

It's also a great idea to follow those kind souls working on our behalf in the web standards space. More often these days drafts of potential specs are posted early on social networks meaning you have a chance to both review and if you're interested, contribute to what the web platform might look like in a few years.
