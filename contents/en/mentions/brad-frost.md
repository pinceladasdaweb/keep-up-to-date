I live on Twitter. I depend on it to give me an idea of what's popular and upcoming, and also what problems people are dealing with. This influences the way I think and the projects I take on.

I also still read web-related RSS feeds, books, magazines and more when I travel.

The other big thing that I find essential for keeping up to date on new technology is to experiment. Find some time outside of your normal job to tinker with a project, contribute to someone else's, or play around with a new bit of technology. Play, fail, succeed, share, repeat.
