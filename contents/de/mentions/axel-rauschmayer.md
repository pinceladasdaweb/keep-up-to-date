I recommend three resources for staying up to date on front end technologies.

First, Twitter is invaluable. Start with famous JavaScript people you know (e.g. the creator of your framework of choice) and continue from there â€“ sooner or later you will come across interesting retweets, recommendations on who to follow, etc.

Second, [Echo JS](http://www.echojs.com/) is a JavaScript news site in the tradition of Hacker News.

Third, the Cooper Press [email newsletters](https://cooperpress.com/) are a convenient weekly source of information.
