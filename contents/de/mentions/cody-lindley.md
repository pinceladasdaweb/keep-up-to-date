I keep up with front-end technologies religiously. As part of my daily activities, I spend 20 to 30 minutes reviewing twitter and RSS feeds, investigating anything that sparks my interest.

I am also regularly reading (books), watching (videos), or writing about my practice. From time to time I pick a coding, or writing, project and focus all of my spare time in this area. When I tire of writing words or code I simply spend time reading code.

When I'm feeling burnt out I'll attend a conference so that I can be inspired by ideas and people. And when I am really bored I start looking into practices that cross over into my area of expertise.

The secret to keeping up is not to view it as an extra chore, but instead as part of the job I've chosen.
